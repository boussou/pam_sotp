## description

Pam_sotp provides a simple one time password mechanism for Linux-PAM
(Pluggable Authentication Modules).

Pam_sotp is still under early stages of development. Although it
seems to work pretty good be warned that this software could contain
severe bugs that may put at risk the security of your system. Until
a stable release is reached you are advised to not use pam_sotp on
mission-critical systems or production servers.
