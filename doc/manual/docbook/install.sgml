<sect1><title>Installing pam_sotp</title>

<para>
Starting with version 0.2 pam_sotp has a autoconf-style build system. This means
that you should be able to compile & install pam_sotp with the commands:

<Synopsis>
	./configure
	make
	make install
</Synopsis>
</para>

<para>
As well as the usual arguments (<literal>--prefix</literal>, etc..) the  <command>configure</command> scripts accepts 
the following pam_sotp specific arguments:

<itemizedlist mark=opencircle>
<listitem><para>
<literal>--with-randondev</literal> Device used to gather random data. The default is <literal>/dev/random</literal>. You might
want to use the pseudorandom generator <literal>/dev/urandom</literal> instead; password generation will be much faster at the 
cost of less (cryptographically) strong passwords.
If the
device given does not exists or is not a character device, glibc's <function>random()</function> will be used instead. 
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
<literal>--with-authdir</literal> Default authentication directory. If not given, <literal>/etc/sotp</literal> will be used
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
<literal>--enable-debug</literal> Verbose logging with syslog
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>
pam_sotp requires a <literal>shadow</literal> system group to work. This group will own all the authentication
databases and directories in the system. Most linux installations already have this group, so you don't have to worry
about this. If you don't have a <literal>shadow</literal> group, (<literal>configure</literal> script will complain about
it) try to create it by hand. Also contact me so I can figure out some fix for the next release.
