pam_sotp provides simple one time password support to PAM, the
pluggable authentication modules. This module only provides PAM auth services

<sect2><title>Usage scenario</title>
<para>
The user is provided with a list of one time passwords. each time the
user wants to authenticate against an sotp-enabled service he or she will
be asked to enter an specific password of the list. in case of successful 
authentication that password will become invalid or valid only for a configured period
of time (depending on how the service was configured) and the service will ask for a different
password next time.
</para>

<para>
This list of one time passwords (OTP list) is typically stored in print
form and stored in the user's wallet or in electronic form in the user's PDA or
cell phone.
</para>

<para>
Optionally passwords can be configured with a 'prefix', which
is another password which the user has to memorize and which has to
be written as a prefix of the requested one time password. The prefix
acts as a security measure in case that the OTP list is lost or stolen
from the user.
</para>

<para>
The system administrator can configure a service in such a way
that entered passwords are valid for a configured period of time. This feature, which we
will call password lifespan, is useful when the application requesting the authentication 
will have to authenticate several more times in a period of time (for example, a webmail application
authenticating against the IMAP server).
