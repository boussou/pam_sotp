<sect2><title>Creating a new authentication database</title>

<para>
pam_sotp stores authentication information in <emphasis>authentication databases</emphasis>. Each authentication 
database contains the information used to authenticate one user. Authentication databases are grouped into authentication
directories. Each pam_sotp-enabled PAM service will authenticate against an authentication directory (by default 
<literal>/etc/sotp</literal>, but this can be changed for each service). If the user to be authenticated doesn't 
have an authentication database under the inspected authentication directory, pam_sotp refuses to authenticate
him/her, giving control back to the PAM module stack.
</para>

<para>
The support utilities for pam_sotp have been merged into one utility: <Command>otppasswd</Command>. Once you
have installed pam_sotp all you have to do to create a new authentication databasefor your user is to run the 
<Command>otppasswd</Command>
command. <Command>otppasswd</Command> usage is straightforward:

<Synopsis>
$ otppasswd -h
otppasswd v.0.3.3  (C) 2004 Pedro Diaz (sotp@cavecanen.org)

Usage: otppasswd [OPTIONS]

Available options:

  -o file           File used to store the OTP list
  -n number         Number of passwords to generate (default: 20)
  -p prefix         Prefix to add in each generated password (default: No prefix)
  -l length         Length of each generated password (default: 5)
  -t lifespan       Built-in password lifespan, in seconds (default: 0)
  -e days           Make the auth database expire in x days (default: don't expire)
  -c charset        Charset used when generating passwords (default: 0123456789)
  -d authdir        Authentication directory (default: /etc/sotp/)
  -P                Pretty-print the OTP list
  -D                Disable the auth database
  -E                Enable the auth database
  -h                Show this help message
</Synopsis>
</para>

<para>
If the options <command>-D</command> or <command>-E</command> are not specified, <command>otppasswd</command> will 
create a new authentication database overwriting  any previous database that the user might have in the
authentication directory. This means that you can use <command>otppasswd</command> to generate a new
OTP list when you are near to run out of passwords. Keep in mind that since <command>otppasswd</command>
overwrites the previous database your previous OTP list won't be valid anymore.
</para>

<para>
The option <command>-D</command> disables an existing authentication database. The authentication data will still be
there but pam_sotp will refuse to use it. The option <command>-E</command> enables a previously disabled database.

<sect2><title>Configuring the pam_sotp module</title>

<para>
The <literal>pam_sotp.so</literal> module accepts the following options:
</para>

<itemizedlist mark=opencircle>

<listitem><para>
<Literal>auth_dir=<Replaceable>path</Replaceable></Literal>  Path to the SOTP authentication directory. If not specified the default
(specified with the <command>configure</command> script when pam_sotp was compiled, or <literal>/etc/sotp</literal> if none
was specified) will be used
</para></listitem>


<listitem><para>
<literal>fail_delay=<Replaceable>nsecs</Replaceable></literal> Plan a delay of at least <Replaceable>nsecs</Replaceable> seconds after a 
failed authentication. The actual number of seconds of waiting depends on PAM and the module stack. The default for this option
is zero seconds.
</para></listitem>


<listitem><para>
<literal>prompt_number=<replaceable>&lt;yes|no&gt;</replaceable></literal> Include the password number in the prompt. The default
for this option is to include the password number in the prompt.
</para></listitem>


<listitem><para>
<literal>pw_lifespan=<replaceable>nsecs</replaceable></literal> Set the password lifespan value for this service. The default
for this option is cero seconds.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<sect3><title>Example</title>
<para>
We want to configure the login service with SOTP support. We
also want to let in other non-SOTP users. SOTP users must also be able to
log-in with their regular password.
</para>

<para>
The file <literal>/etc/pam.d/login</literal> will look something like this:
<Synopsis>
auth sufficient pam_sotp.so prompt_number=yes 
account required        pam_unix.so
</Synopsis>
</para>

<para>
SOTP users (the ones with an auth database in <literal>/etc/sotp</literal>) will be asked
for an OTP. If the OTP is wrong they will be asked for their regular
password:
<screen>
	odiel:~# telnet localhost
	Trying 127.0.0.1...
	Connected to localhost.localdomain.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 odiel
	odiel login: susan

	One time password [01]: <co id="otppasswd">
	Password:
</screen>

<calloutlist>

<callout arearefs="otppasswd">
<para>The wrong OTP was introduced</para>
</callout>

</calloutlist>
</para>

<para>
Non-SOTP users won't notice difference:
<screen>
	odiel:~# telnet localhost
	Trying 127.0.0.1...

	Connected to localhost.localdomain.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 odiel
	odiel login: pdiaz
	Password:

<sect3><title>Password lifespan</title>

<para>
With the options <literal>pw_lifespan</literal> in the module configuration and
<literal>-t </literal> in <command>otppasswd</command>
 you can configure pam_sotp to authenticate a service with 
<emphasis>limited time passwords</emphasis>. This basically means that pam_sotp will handle authentication in the
same way as before but with the following additional feature: an used password will remain valid for some time 
after its first use. Of course, the prompted password will be also valid.
</para>

<para>
The actual amount of time an older password will remain valid is calculated as the minimum of the value specified in 
<literal>/etc/pam.d/service</literal> configuration file and the value specified with <Command>otppasswd</Command> 
when the user database was created.
This means that specifying a value of zero in either of these places will disable password lifespan for that pam service or
authentication database.
</para>

<para>
Limited Time Passwords are useful for using pam_sotp with software that requires several authentications against a service
in a short period of time, such as some webmail systems (<ulink url="http://www.squirrelmail.org/">Squirrelmail</ulink> 
has this behavior).
