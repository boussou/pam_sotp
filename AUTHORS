pam_sotp was started by Pedro Diaz <sotp@cavecanen.org>, who is the lead
developer and current maintainer of the project. A number of people
have/are contributed/contributing to pam_sotp:

 - Jose Luis Tallon <projects+sotp@adv-solutions.net> has contributed
 with a lot of great ideas, and more important: has pointed out some
 really bad ideas on some of my designs ;-)

 - Christophe Devine <c.devine@cr0.net> is the author of a very nice
 GPL implementation of the SHA-1 algorithm which is used in pam_sotp
 (http://www.cr0.net:8040/code/crypto/sha1/).
